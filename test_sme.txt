GOALS OF ASTHMA TREATMENT 
The goals of chronic asthma management may be divided into two domains: achieving good control of asthma-related symptoms and minimizing future risk (asthma exacerbations, suboptimal lung function, adverse effects of medication). The patient’s personal goals and preferences should be incorporated into a shared decision-making approach regarding asthma management. 
 
Optimizing control of asthma symptoms – Good control of asthma means reducing the intensity and frequency of asthma symptoms and maintaining normal or near normal activity levels.  
 
Specific goals for asthma control include: 
 
	•	Freedom from frequent or troublesome symptoms of asthma (cough, chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath) 
 
	•	Rare to no night-time awakenings due to asthma 
 
	•	Minimal need for medication for acute relief of asthma symptoms 
 
	•	Optimized lung function 
 
	•	Maintenance of normal daily activities, including work or school attendance and participation in athletics and exercise 
 
	•	Satisfaction with asthma care on the part of patients and caregivers 
 
Reducing future risk – The concept of risk encompasses the various adverse outcomes associated with asthma and its treatment. These include asthma exacerbations, suboptimal lung development (children), loss of lung function over time (adults), and adverse effects from asthma medications. A history of ≥1 exacerbation(s) in the past year is an independent risk factor for future exacerbations, as are poor adherence to asthma medication, incorrect inhaler technique, low lung function, smoking (eg, tobacco, cannabis) or vaping, an elevated concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (fractional exhaled nitric oxide, FENO), and blood eosinophilia (table 1). 
 
Specific goals for reducing risk include: 
 
	•	Prevention of recurrent exacerbations and need for systemic glucocorticoids and emergency department or hospital care 
 
	•	Prevention of reduced lung growth in children and loss of lung function in adults (due to poor asthma control) 
 
	•	Optimization of asthma pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects
